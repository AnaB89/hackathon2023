# Security Management Console

The svySecurity has a companion administration console, svySecurityConsoleUX, which provides out of the box intuitive options for all security-related administration tasks along with some useful summary and usage statistics. This modern svySecurityConsoleUX deprecates the former [svySecurityConsole](classic-security-management-console.md).

Only users that are members of the built-in Servoy security Administrators group can access the Security Management Console. You can create administrator user accounts on the [Servoy Application Server admin page](https://wiki.servoy.com/display/public/DOCS/Servoy+Admin+Page). You can learn more about [User and Group Security](https://wiki.servoy.com/display/DOCS/Defining+User+and+Group+Security).
