# Calendar Inline

## Overview

Calendar-Inline is an input control component. It allows a user us a date-picker to choose Date values for a bound data-provider.

Similar to the Calendar component, the Calendar-Inline provides a date-picker interface to choose a date. The key difference is that the Calendar component is an input field that the shows the date-picker in a popup only when clicked; whereas the Calendar Inline shows the date-picker directly on the form

Common use cases include selecting a value for a filter or search parameter.
