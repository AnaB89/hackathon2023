The Collapsible Container is a responsive container, to be used in a Servoy Responsive Form, which behaves as a toggle on small screen sizes. When the size of the screen is smaller than 992px it presents a toggle section on which the user can click to toggle the visibility of it's content. On medium and large screens instead it always display it's content and hide it's toggle section.
