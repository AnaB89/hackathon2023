| formattingFunction         | String                              | null               | Can be given a function code as string that can be used to format numbers client side. The formatting function receives the value to be formatted and the type of value it gets. As value types it can receive one of 'value', 'high' (the high label), 'floor' (the floor label), 'ceil' (the ceil label) or 'tick-value'. It can return any string that will be used to display the given value. See [Function properties](Slider.md#function-properties) on how to provide a function.                                                                                           |
| getLegendFunction          | String                              | null               | Can be given a function code as string that can be used to display legend under ticks (thus, it needs to be used along with showTicks or showTicksValues). The function will be called with each tick value and returned content will be displayed under the tick as a legend. If the returned value is null, then no legend is displayed under the corresponding tick. You can also directly provide the legend values in the `stepsValueList` option.

The function receives the value and pointerType (either `value` or `high`) as argument. _If your color won't change, don't use this option but set it through CSS._ See [Function properties](Slider.md#function-properties) on how to provide a function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

When the min handle goes above the max, the max is moved as well (and vice-versa). The range between min and max is defined by the step option (defaults to 1) and can also be override by the minRange option.

| selectionBarColorFunction  | String                              | null               | Function code as String that returns the current color of the selection bar. _If your color won't change, don't use this option but set it through CSS._ If the returned color depends on a model value (either dataProvider or dataProviderHigh), you should use the value argument passed to the function. Indeed, when the function is called, there is no certainty that the model has already been updated. The function receives the value and the valueHigh when using range sliders.

### Function properties

Some properties above are named "Function" that take a string with the full function definition. Please not that a function reference to a Servoy function will not work (something like forms.abc.myMethod).

These functions are sent to the client as such and will execute client side. This reduces the roundtrips to the server.

Here is an example of the `formattingFunction` that will divide each value by 1000 and display values with 1 decimal and a 'k' at the end, while tick values show without decimals:

```
function formatValue(value, type) { 	
	value = value / 1000;
	if (type === 'value' || type === 'high') {
		return numberFormat(value, '#,###.0') + 'k'; 
	} else {
		return numberFormat(value, '#,###') + 'k'; 
	}
}
```

**Note:** the example method above calls a method `numberFormat` which formats a number with the given Servoy format. This method is always present client side and can be called by any function provided to the component.

This function has been entered in designer as a string as shown below:

## Custom types

### Gradient type

Gradient is a component specific javascript type used for `selectionBarGradient` property the with the following properties:

| Property | Type  | Default | Description                      |
| -------- | ----- | ------- | -------------------------------- |
| from     | Color | null    | the `from` color of the gradient |
| to       | Color | null    | the `to` color of the gradient   |

## Slider events

| Event            | Params                                                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| onDataChange     | <p>oldValue:Object,<br>newValue:Object,<br>event:JSEvent</p>                      | Called when the dataProvider value changed. Note that depending on the property `dataChangeOnSlideEnd` the onDataChange event is either only fired when the user stops sliding or for each step the users slides over.         |
| onDataChangeHigh | <p>oldValue:Object,<br>newValue:Object,<br>event:JSEvent</p>                      | Called when the dataProviderHigh value changed. Note that depending on the property `dataChangeOnSlideEnd` the onDataChangeHigh event is either only fired when the user stops sliding or for each step the users slides over. |
| onSlideStart     | <p>event:JSEvent,<br>value:Object,<br>highValue:Object,<br>pointerType:String</p> | Fired when the user starts sliding. The pointerType provided is either `value` or `high` depending on which slider is dragged when using a range slider                                                                        |
| onSlideEnd       | <p>event:JSEvent,<br>value:Object,<br>highValue:Object,<br>pointerType:String</p> | Fired when the user stops sliding. The pointerType provided is either `value` or `high` depending on which slider is dragged when using a range slider                                                                         |

## Slider API

The slider component currently has only API method:

| Method                       | Params | Return | Description            |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ---------------------- |
| [refresh](Slider.md#refresh) |        | void   | Re-renders the slider. |

### refresh

Re-renders the slider.

**Params** none

**Returns** none

## Custom styling

The Slider component consists of one `<div>` containing the slider element. The outer div has the `svy-slider-container` class attached, while the slider itself can be addressed using the `svy-slider` class and/or the ones that were set via the styleClass property.

To address single items of the slider, these classes can be used:

| element selector        | summary        |
| ----------------------- | -------------- |
| .svy-slider .rz-bar     | the slider bar |
| .svy-slider .rz-pointer | the pointer    |
| .svy-slider .rz-tick    | a tick         |
| .svy-slider .rz-bubble  | a label bubble |
