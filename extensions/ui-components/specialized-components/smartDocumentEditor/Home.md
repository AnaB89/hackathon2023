# Smart Document Editor

## Getting Started

Welcome to the **Smart Docs Editor** project wiki! The editor is a standard Web Component which can be added to your Servoy application. To get going, simply open the Servoy Package Manager (SPM) in your IDE and choose the Smart Document Editor package. The component will be installed and available to place on your form.

\* Please see the companion [**Smart Docs Utils API**](../../../modules/svyUtils/Smart-Doc-Editor-Utils.md#contents) module for the best documentation and examples.

**Working with documents**

Like all the standard input controls, the editor can be bound to a _"Data Provider"_ in your project. This means that the document contents will be automatically rendered from, and updated to any persistent data source column or session variable. In short, loading and saving documents is easy!
