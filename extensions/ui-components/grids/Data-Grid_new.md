# Data Grid

Data Grid is a table providing advanced functionalities such as row grouping for the given foundset.

This table component is designed to work with large data, potentially infinite, since data is loaded lazily into the table even when grouped; group nodes are loaded lazily with incremental scrolling and children of groups are loaded only when the nodes are expanded; also children of groups are loaded incrementally with scrolling.

**IMPORTANT !** Grouping is not yet supported for foundset having multiple primary key columns. To use grouping feature of this component the foundset **MUST** have a single primary key.

**Note**: since all data is loaded lazily on demand, the table doesn't provide any built in aggregation functionality such as count, sum, max, min etc.

## Features

The table fetch data from a foundset; as common table components it can be bound to the form's foundset, to a related foundset, to a separate foundset or to a named foundset. It has typical table features, (fixed) table header, formats, styling, cell editing, column resize, column move, column sort, valuelist support (for translating a real value to a display value). The model and API can be seen in Servoy Developer.

The table can be grouped on any foundset's dataprovider or related dataprovider by setting the _rowGroupIndex_ in the column's properties. The grouped columns can be configured at design time and the user can change grouping criteria at runtime if enableRowGroup is true.

**IMPORTANT !** Calculations Aggregations or form variables SHOULD not be used in group mode and _enableRowGroup_ MUST be set to false.

When there are no groups it behaves like a common readOnly table, however it has a limited set of features compared to the default table of Servoy or the [Servoy Extra Table](Table.md#table-of-contents).

#### Unsupported features

Currently the table doesn't support the following features

* The grouping cannot be performed if the foundset has multiple primary keys. A single primary key is required.
* The table doesn't support paging but only infinite scrolling.

At Servoy we are aware of the importance of these features and our intention is to integrate relevant features during the next releases of the grouping table component.

#### Data changes and Data broadcast

When the table is showing plain rows without grouped columns it updates spontaneously it’s rows at any data change which affect the rows visible in the table viewport; as common tables in Servoy the table component receive foundset updates which may be originated from a foundset update within the client itself or from a data broadcast update; it always presents the latest data to the user when the columns are not grouped.

This is not the case when the table is grouping one ore more columns; a data update may affect how the group are displayed; a new group node or sub-node may be created or even removed after a data update. Adding and removing groups on the fly will result on a bad user experience therefore the table component doesn’t react proactively to data updates.

The table lets the user to ask for latest data with a “Refresh Data” action; the refresh button will show up to the top-right corner of the table when there are grouped columns.

When the table receives any data change ( either a record insert, a record delete or a record update for any of the columns in table ) which affect the records in it’s viewport, the table will notify the user highlighting the “Refresh Data” action; by default the refresh button is colored as orange to notify the user of a pending data change. You can style in CSS the refresh button when highlighted with the _.ag-table-info-notify_ style Class.

Notice that, for obvious perfomance reasons, the table components won’t listen for data changes on the whole foundset’s table (and related foundset table) but only for the data in table's viewport; the implication of this is that if a table record, which is not in viewport, is being updated (for instance the client receives a data broadcast from another client) the table component won’t be notified even if the update may result in a new group node within the table viewport.

If you would like to notify the table component of ANY data change, you can use the notifyDataChange api of the component. The [notifyDataChange](Data-Grid\_new.md#grouping-table-api) api is best use in conjunction with the onDataBroadcast event of Servoy to notify the table of any data change from other clients and with the onAfterRecordInsert, onAfterRecordUpdate, onAfterRecordDelete events to notify the table of any data changes within the client; the client doesn’t receive a data broadcast notification for it’s own changes, therefore if the foundset’s record (or the related foundset’s record if related dataproviders are used in columns), which are not in the viewport, are changed in background you can rely on the onAfterRecordInsert/Update/Delete, or proactively notify the table component in your business logic. Please note that it’s not necessary to notify the table component is the component is not visible; the component will always present the latest data when rendered again.

#### Record selection

When the table is showing plain rows without grouped columns it highlights the selected record in foundset; if the selected record in foundset is changed serverside the table will change the selection to the new record however it won't scroll to the selected record but will remain to it's position.

When the table is grouping one ore more columns instead the record selection is disabled. If you would like to use change the selected record in foundset you can use the onCellClickEvent to change record selection on the foundset. Please note that the foundsetIndex param of the onCellClickEvent will always be -1 when there are grouped columns; use the pks of the record object to select the clicked record.

#### Configuration

The table is configurable from _Properties View_ - in Developer. In the future more properties will be configurable at runtime via scripting.

#### Grid Height in Responsive Form

It can be used both in responsive forms and absolute forms. If used in responsive mode, its 'responsiveHeight' property must be set in _Properties View_ (which is the fixed height it will occupy).

Adding a table in a flex-content layout and setting the table responsiveHeight property to 0, let the table grow up to 100% height of parent element (see more on flex-layout [here](../../layout/12grid/Flexbox-Layout.md#getting-started)). Used with other containers than flex-content layout in order to grow the table to 100% height, the parent element must have a known height.

#### Using custom cell editor

It is possible to use a form as a custom editor, by setting the 'editType' of a column to 'FORM' and 'editForm' to the desired form. When a cell will enter edit mode, the form will be shown in a popup and the 'onColumnFormEditStarted' handler will be called; this is where you can setup the values displayed in the form. To update the edited cell value with the result of the form editor, the 'setFormEditorValue' api function should be used (ex. if you have a save/ok button in the editor, this is the function that you need to call to set the result of the editing). In order to stop the editing and close the form editor popup, the 'stopCellEditing' api should be used.

## Styling Grouping Table

There are several CSS class selectors you can use for fine-grained styling of the grouping table component.

| String       | filterType             | null (NONE) | Type of filter used for that column. Can be one of the followings: null (NONE), TEXT, NUMBER, DATE, VALUELIST, RADIO. When TEXT is used, it is possible to filter on null values using '^' , or on null/empty string values using '^=' as value, along with equals or not equals operators. NOTE: When a filter is applied, NGGrids uses the Servoy API 'addFoundSetFilterParam' to add a custom filter to the grid's foundset, that will be removed when the filter is cleared or the grid is hidden. That also means that the selected index when the filter is applied is different then that of the foundset without filter, so when you navigate away from a filtered grid (it is hidden and filter removed), you can't use its selected index on the same foundset in a different form, where it will be without the filter - you should rely on the pk of the selected record, save that in the filtered grid and use that in the new form. |
