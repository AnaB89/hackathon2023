## Getting uploaded file name and mime type

To get the name and mime type of the uploaded file, you need to create form variables, on the component's parent form, with the following names, 'dataprovider\_filename' and 'dataprovider\_mimetype', where 'dataprovider' is the dataprovider name of the component. These form variables will be filled with the right values after the file is uploaded. Ex.: you have a fileupload component, with dataprovider : 'picture', after the upload, if the form variables 'picture\_filename' and 'picture\_mimetype' exits, they will have the uploaded file name and mime type.

## File upload properties

The component has the following properties:
